This is the power script
It tells you all you need to know about your battery in real time
It's much faster than normal battery info applications

To be clear, this DOES NOT work in windows
This is made for linux and mac (i think) only
(unless you use a linux emulator but it won't work because there won't be any devices on it)

Install instructions:
1. Unzip the power-master.zip
2. Open terminal
3. Cd to wherever you unzipped the download (ex: "cd ~/Downloads/power-master")
4. Do "chmod +x install.sh" 
5. Do "sudo ./install.sh" to install it

To execute the power script, just type "power" in your command line (ex: $ power)
